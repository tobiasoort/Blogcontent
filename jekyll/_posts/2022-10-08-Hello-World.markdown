# Hello world!

This is my new blog. I’ve not blogged in a long time, and this is the first time I’m trying this out ‘at large’.
I’ll be mainly writing about all things Azure, Open Source, Containers, Cloud-Native and tech in general. I might even throw in some home automation now and then.

Usually the issue with blogs is actually writing content. For me this is no different; so i’ve already started writing content before actually publishing this blog. I’m trying new things, but my current plan for this process is:

1. Write content in Markdown, in a private Gist as a scratchpad, to just ‘catch the flow’
2. When something feels like it’s going somewhere, commit it in my public Github blogcontent repository
3. Add image content, maybe generate some charts using PlantUML (i’ve got a neat idea for this) 
4. Get some fancy Jekyll theme to make it pretty
5. Host it as cheap as possible in Azure

My goals are:

- I want to empty my brain into a blog as efficiently and quickly as possible
- Automate all the things
- Do it for as little money possible 
- Do it right, in line with [Azure Well Architected Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/)
 

Of course the execution of this plan, and the things I find along the way, are content as well. I’m trying to do everything out in the open; all content will be open-source and the only thing you won’t be able to access are secrets stored in Github and Azure keyvault.

Well, lets see how this goes!
